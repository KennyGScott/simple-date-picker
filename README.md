# Simple Date Picker


A simple calendar based datepicker component for Angular, very loosely based on https://github.com/kuvelas/mk-date-range-picker.

### Basic usage:
`<simple-date-picker [(date)]="dateSelected"></simple-date-picker>`

### Inputs:
`importantDates: An array of dates in YYYY-MM-DD format to be highlighted on the calendar`

### Contribute
Like most libraries, this one could use some improvements.
